            I am interested in animal reproduction, with a strong focus on behavior, selection, and life-history trade-offs. 
            My research goal is to better understand how variation in sexually selected traits arises, as well as the limitations on that variation. Ultimately, I wish to understand how that variation leads to reproductive success or failure in the context of sexual selection. I have used a broad suite of techniques in this pursuit, from micro-dissections, CT scanning, and behavioral observations, to classical selection analysis. I have had the privilege to work with a wide variety of invertebrate study systems, including leeches, isopods, leaf-footed bugs, and freshwater sponges.

        I am currently looking for a postdoctoral position, following the completion of my PhD in August 2025. I am excited to expand the range of tools I have to answer the questions that interest me, and immerse myself in a new research environment.
